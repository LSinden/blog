Hey, I'm Dean!

From an early age I’d jump at the chance to work with anything involving colouring pencils and a pot of PVA - all hail Neil Buchanan. 

After studying Art and Graphic Design in school, I went on to further my knowledge at college and University, where I was greeted with new methods of communicating design and unexpected all-nighters in the library.

My career in Design began during 2008, where I was tasked to create signage for small business' in Torbay. I then moved onto branding, information, and then editorial design where daily tasks included the design and management of magazines which were printed in the 00’s of 000’s. 

At present, I'm grateful to be a Senior Designer at the Met Office in Exeter, where my love for everything creative is ever-more growing! Working on various projects, daily duties could range from designing bespoke animations and info-graphics, to collaborating with scientists and programmers to create pixel-perfect visuals for tomorrow's technology.
