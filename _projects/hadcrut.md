## Project description
The Global Temperature Visualisation Project is a 3D interactive globe that illustrates how global temperatures have risen since records began. Created for the [COP Climate Change Conference](http://unfccc.int/meetings/marrakech_nov_2016/meeting/9567.php), it displays the Met Office Hadley Centre's [HadCRUT4 dataset](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/), using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) as the 3D framework.  

When this interactive animation went live it was the most popular tweet Met Office Science  had ever shared. Click to see the [Global Temperature Visualisation](http://hadcrut4.datavis.informaticslab.co.uk/)
