## Project description
BellHouse is a playful, interactive sound sculpture that translated the non-verbal communication of the delegates presenting at the EUPORIAS General Assembly in October 2016 into the chimes of fifty bells in an opened sided house. I was the idea of local artist [Roop Johnstone](http://www.rampceramics.com/) in response to a commission by [Kaleider](http://kaleider.com/). You can find out more about the project [here](http://kaleider.com/projects/bellhouse/).

A motion capture system devised by the Met Office Informatics Lab activated striking mechanisms associated with each ceramic bell generating a continuous chiming whilst each speaker at the 250 delegate conference presented their findings.

BellHouse also invited Met Office scientists to interact through their work.  It played video climate data to curious staff and passers by in the main Met Office thoroughfare known as `the Street'.  Some of our favourite data translated into sound included Etnaâ€™s volcanic plumes, the European drought of 1976, solar winds, 250 years of English and Welsh anomalies in temperature and precipitation and the Fog of Uncertainty.
