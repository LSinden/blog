## Project Description

Statistician George Box said, “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. This project will use machine learning to spot and extract this useful information. This will allow us to link different computer models together more effectively. It will also allow us to better link these models to the real world so we can predict the things we care about.

### Why combine models?

The real world is complex. To make sense of it, we can use computer "models" - calculations which can represent and predict different parts of the real world.

There are some things we would like to predict which can’t be described by any single model. By understanding how each model describes the world and what their limitations are, we can figure out the best way to use them together.

### Why machine learning?

When we talk about combining models in the "best" way, what this really means is, whichever way gives the best predictions. This is an exercise in function approximation; the goal is to use a combination of models to approximate real-world effects.

Machine learning contains many powerful and flexible techniques for function approximation, which have been successfully applied in other fields. 

### Another perspective

To look at this from another point of view - why use models at all? Why not just feed observations into a machine learning algorithm and let it learn to predict the weather?

The reason is that weather models are based on known laws of physics. Using machine learning to rediscover these laws will not gain us anything. 

However, learning to use known laws to best effect would be of significant benefit to meteorology, and environmental science more broadly.
