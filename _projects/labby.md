We make extensive use of [Slack](https://slack.com/) Instant Messenger in the Lab. We've made it even more useful by adding our very own [Slackbot](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) called Labby: you can go and have a look at the source code [here](https://github.com/met-office-lab/labby-the-rat). Labby is based on the [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) project.

Labby's skills range from highly functional, to highly amusing. Here is an (ever growing) list of Labby's best tricks, which we access by talking to her:

1. Monitor our Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances
1. Temporarily grant us enhanced privileged AWS credentials to allow us to start new instances
1. Add and remove Cron jobs
1. Regularly ask us what we've been working on and keep a record of our answers for the time sheet
1. Most important of all, she brightens up our work days by greeting you in the morning, and inserting relevant pop-culture references into our Instant Message conversations.
