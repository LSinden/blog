## Project Description
People don't care about the weather. Not on the whole. Usually they want to know the weather to make a decision about something personal to them. Members of the public might really want to know "Should I take my umbrella when I leave for work?" or "Am I better off going for a hike or going to the cinema on Saturday?". We though, why not let people just ask what they want to know?

We also think that these kind of "natural language processes" are going to become ever more prevalent over the next few years. Perhaps our scientists will be speaking to their computers rather than typing in years to come.
