## Project Description
Our Weather Impacts team has been working on making a product knows as the Global Hazard Map, which uses open source project [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org/) to let decision makers collate and inspect official hazard warnings from several key institutions. The Lab and the Weather Impacts Team have collaborated to let officials access this information from anywhere in the world. We have made use of technologies such as [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Graphana](http://grafana.org/), and [FluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) to make the deployment modern, robust, flexible and reproducible.

The Global Hazard Map visualises many different types of hazards on an interactive map. Central government need to consider a lot of different factors when they are trying to respond to mixed hazards around the world. At the Met Office, one of our primary goals is to provide information so that authorities can mitigate the worst effects of extreme weather. But these situations need to be considered in the context of other hazards - for instance, as storm hitting in the aftermath of an earthquake is a far more grave situation, requiring a different type of response from government.

With Global Hazard Map, government can now consider all these hazards simultaneously, and so respond more effectively.
