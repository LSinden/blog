## Is the sky the same for everybody?
People can take issue with the weather forecast. A **sunny day** can be different from one person to another. Look at the pictures below.

<cite>We agree, this one is a partly cloudy day …</cite>

![sunny day](https://darcynorman.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2011-04-24-easter-sun-day.jpg)
<cite>… and that one a sunny day. No doubt.</cite>

<cite>But here, people can hesitate …</cite>

![sunny or cloudy day 2](http://soviet-off.com/data/out/6/IMG_414284.jpg)
<cite>… and disagree with the forecaster.</cite>

![snowy day](https://www.harpcolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Snow-row.jpg)
<cite>It is sunny here. However the snow is the main fact to choose what you are going to do for the day.</cite>

That’s why **we are developing a new mobile phone application** to solve this concern.
The user is going to be able to **teach to the app** what is a cloudy sky for him, a sunny sky or even a snowy sky: it is going to be ** *YOUR* Sky**. Each day, you will choose what you think is the most relevant icon to describe the actual weather.

## What is next?
We would like to ask these same questions for the **temperature**. In fact, is a cold day less than 4, 8 or 12 Celsius degrees ? It depends on the person.
At the end, we are planning for the app to be able to provide you an **appropriate and personal forecast**.

Soon on the AppStore!
